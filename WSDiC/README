	Semantically disambiguated gold corpus



The Norwegian Language Bank has initiated a annotation of a gold corpus
for Norwegian Bokmål and Nynorsk. As a part of the deliverables for the
WordNet project, this corpus will be provided with partial semantic 
annotation. 

Currently only a short exerpt is distributed for illustrative purposes
(Norwegian Bokmål only).

The last field (tenth column) in the CONLL format used in the
syntactic annotation is used to store the ontological type and numeric
id of the relevant synset for the annotated token. This is not stricly
in accordance with the specifications of the CONLL format, which does
not provide a field for semantic annotation. Where this field is not a
number, it is one of "lak" (word missing from the wordnet), "nil"
(word in wordnet, but not this particular meaning), "pos" (word not in
the wordnet, pos analysis is correct), "inval", "skipped" or
completely empty (not annotated yet).

Up to 10 instances of each lexeme will be annotated. The exeption is a
group of very complex words (like "tid" (time), "ha" (to have), "være" 
(to be)), where 25 instances will be annotated. 

The annotation will be incremential, meaning that a significant number
of tokens will not recieve a synset in the first round of annotation. 

Future versions of this corpus will probably be an integrated
part of the Language Bank Gold Corpus.
